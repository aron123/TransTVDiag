# TransTVDiag

TransTVDiag is a Transformer-based multi-modal failure diagnosis method for microservice systems. It includes Failure Type Identification (FTI) and Root Cause Localization (RCL).

Our method is an enhancement of [TVDiag](https://github.com/WHU-AISE/TVDiag). The experiments are based on the [GAIA](https://github.com/CloudWise-OpenSource/GAIA-DataSet) dataset.
